## How to Become Russia 101

It all started like this - a young KGB agent had a dream... a dream of becoming a strongman dickhead. One who controlled every facet of society so that he could one day spend his last days on his throne, threatening the world with nuclear apocolypse while shitting into his adult diaper. Clenching his hands to make himself feel powerful, because he is such a coward inside that he must carpet bomb Ukrainians to make himself feel like a big, powerful man.

This is the story of Vladimir Putin, the coward Kremlin who stole power from the apathetic Russian people who are being thrown into a meat grinder in order to satisfy his psycopathic needs as a "strongman", limpdick dictator. Did I mention his dick is limp?
