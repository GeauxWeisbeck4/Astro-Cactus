## Welcome to the Rebel's Advocate!

What does this blog aim to achieve? Enlightenment? No. Brainwashing you until your a cuckolding liberal? God no. Making you think about things a little differently in order to save our world from the monsters who currently seek to suck out all its resources and shit them into their gold, hidden in a layer protected by fire breathing dragons? Abso-fucking-lutely!

Listen, I have tried to convince others to think like me, be like me, or care about others like me and it is the most futile activity that I have ever good-heartedly attempted. But I don't think our world is totally fucked - yet. I still think that there is power in providing truth and a different alternative to the mainstream way of thinking so that we can alter the current course of destruction that humanity has chosen for our dear, beloved, green mother earth.

That is what the Rebel's Advocate is about - providing you with the facts so you can properly arm yourself against the coming armageddon that White Christian Nationalists believe is their right and religious duty to force upon the rest of society who only wants to love their significant other and hang out in the woods and smoke weed. Yes, I may be very opinionated, but I hope you disagree with me and prove me wrong - but I do hope you also listen to some of my warnins and heed the seriousness of this point in our history of the world.

We are closer to destruction than many of us would like to believe. Maybe we'll avoid nuclear apocolypse, overheating of the earth, and sheer genocide of the masses by reserving the few necessary resources we have for a few rich and powerful nations who have no right or stake to hold onto such resources - maybe. But I am even more terrified of a dystopian society in which "Big Brother" spies on our every move and decides how we think, love, pray, and remember history.

So please heed my warnings - but still, think for yourself!

## You Understand?

Good - great! We can now get started on this journey together! Our journey to help others realize something that I realized long ago - that there are dark shadows that hang over every fabric of our society, attempting to wrangle it in their favor so they can bring death and destruction amongst the masses, while they sit back on their throne of ill-gotten things. Things that they stole from our labour, our love, and our very rights to ownership, only for their pure entertainment.

10% of the population own over 80% of the worlds resources. That sound fucked up? It sounds fucked up to me. If you don't believe that, you really need to catch up to the times amigo and learn about the great divide in wealth that has occurred since the Ronald Reagan era in America. A consequential president who may have done more to accelerate the end of the world than any other human being in the history of our world - all because we were ignorant enough to think that we could trust someone and lay back on our laurels, not challenging and mainstream thought against many dangerous and perverse laws and movements that came about by his conservative agenda.

## I Don't Like You!

That's ok - you don't have to. But please don't dislike the fact that all I'm trying to do is make you think differently. If you agree with too much of what I say, that is not good. That is very bad and I haven't achieved my goal. So please, dislike me and tell me to go fuck myself. I will and love you very much so for telling me to do that.

Hate me all you want, but you will be thankful for seeing the world with a clear, clean glass that causes you to take action today to save the world for the future of your children tomorrow. Wake up people! It's time to change history for the better!

## Thanks For Reading - Please Support Me!

I always love you if you read me - whether you hate me or love me, I love you. I push buttons, agigate conformers, and am an advocate for change. The status quo always sucks and we can always be better - we need people like me who fight the mainstream consciousness because we understand how dangerous groupthink is and how silly ignorance is, but how dangerous it is when wielded as a weapon to achieve power.

If you enjoy this at all, consider sharing it with your friends and family and donating a few bucks towards my cause. I currently could really use the financial help, so anything you contribute is oh-so appreciated. You have no idea how far the smallest contribution will go.

You can donate to our cause by giving or purchasing our merchandise at our store (currently being constructed). The greatest thing you can do however is share this with someone who you may know who could benefit from a change in their thinking or content they consume - someone who could use a rebel's advocate, one who may alter their consciousness for their own personal gain.

I don't aim to change anyone for my own personal gain, but only to make you a more well-rounded and open-minded individual. If that pisses you off, then go fuck yourself you conservative Nazi.

Let freedom ring!
