## Fuck Republicans

I'm not the oldest person around, but I do feel that I have been around long enough and seen enough in my 31 years of existence to understand this - we live in the most dangerous time in modern society, and probably the most dangerous era of human existence. How we got here is not important - I think identifying our gravest threats to saving our planet is paramount to progress and avoiding total annihalation of the only planet that can currently sustain our lives.

I'd like to start out with what I believe is currently the greatest threat to our current society - Republicans. Read on to learn more about why I believe that it is important to vote against Republicans for the forseeable future and what the consequences will be if we let a "Red Wave" hit America in 2024.

## Republican in 2023 = MAGA

I don't sugarcoat things, I don't care if I hurt any feelings. America needs to understand that there is a part of this country that does not give a shit about logic, reason, or empathy - they are simply so far gone in the cult of "Trumpism", that the only thing that will change them is a mass lobotomy that makes them forget all about their dear leader they so admire. We need to understand the concept of "cult" - or one step further, the phenomenon known as a "Cult of the Personality".

Once we understand the power of the Cult and what the Maga personality cult is, only then can we begin to understand the depth of loyalty that these "cult members" have plunged themselves into and that they never can be saved - not for us or from themselves. They have committed themselves into an oath to their dear leader that they will follow him into the depths of hell - or hopefully prison if our country be so lucky to see the first president in our history actually charged with a felony, which he is obviously very guilty of. I just wouldn't hold my breath given the current political climate and our current legal system that seems to favor the powerful, rich, and white.

But if we can understand this - that Republicans are currently in a stranglehold of Trumpism, which is an idea that seeks a facist future for our country, can we begin any effective conversation about how we destroy this cult that is on the tip of cusping the political reigns of the chariot that drives the future of our country.

Do we want democracy or do we want to become a nationalist, minority-hating, fear-mongering society that is hell-bent on destroying the earth for the name of White-Christian Nationalism? You America, can make that decision - but I know that 80% of our country would tremor if they understood the current stakes of our political climate and immediately reject this notion. The problem is much more complicated than simple understanding however, so lets discover some of the psychological underpinnings of this fascism problem and what we can do about it.

## How We Identify in 2023

Lets explore how current Americans categorize themselves in our two-party system that dominates our political landscape:

| Party         | % of Voters | # of People |
| ------------- | :---------: | :---------: |
| Democrats 	|       1.99  |        739 |
| Republicans   |       1.89  |          6 |

With such a staggering amount of our population identifying as Democrats, how can we be under such threat of an extremist, right-wing movement? Well I'm glad you asked!

While this is a complicated question to address, we only need to look at a few major movements by a few major players in politics that have really shifted our political leadership to the right, even though it is dominated by more progressive ideals in the popular opinion of the country.

### Factor 1: Talk-Jock Radio

### Factor 2: The 1% and the 2008 Crisis

### Factor 3: Dark Money & Political Influence

## So a Minority of the Country Makes the Rule? That's Not Democracy!

You're right!
