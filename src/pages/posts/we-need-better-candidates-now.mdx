## We Need Better Candidates Now

And you should run. I'm not kidding, fucking around, or counting anyone out. If you have a good idea or give a shit about the future, run for political office! You don't need any political experience - Trump didn't and he won the most powerful position in the entire world! You don't need to run for president (I think you should throw your name in the hate) but you can make a difference by campaigining for any political position.

I'm not playing around y'all - our country really needs you to do this. I don't care if your shy, hate politics, or don't know what your doing - we need people to care about our government again and the only way that can happen is by total participation of everyone who is of legal age to run for office or vote.
