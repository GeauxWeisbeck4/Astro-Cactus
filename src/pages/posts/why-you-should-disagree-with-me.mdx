## Why You Should Disagree With Me

I hope I don't cause you to become a right-winged extremist who blows up a federal building because of this article, but I hope that you disagree with something that I say each time you read me. If you don't, I'm doing my job horribly - so please help me do my job! You can call me stupid, annoying, or outright pathetic - I don't care, just think for yourself, do your own research, and tell me why I'm wrong.

Why do I care? Because the future of society depends on us all disagreeing with each other - we have become too reliant on group think and niceities. So much so that we are going to burn our world up with nuclear weapons or the suns hot flares before this decade is over.
